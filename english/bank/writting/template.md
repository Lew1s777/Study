```Dear Chris,
  I feel terribly sorry that I can't make my way to our show on the Festival ofTraditional Culture.
  Unfortunately, I hurt myself accidentally when I was playing basketball last night.As a result, I'm suffering a badly fractured arm, which means it's impossible for me to practice Taijiquan for at least a month and my performance will be blown up.It's really a pity that I will fail to show up with you. Knowing that you have been waiting for this moment so long, I strongly recommend Jim replace me. As an enthusiast, he's an excellent Taiji player. Besides, Jim is very cooperative and easygoing, who's the most suitable person I can think of.
  I do understand you need me badly but I still hope you could forgive me.
Yours,
Li Hua

```Dear Chris,
I am terribly sorry to tell you that I cannot participate in the coming Traditional Cultural Festival to be held next month with you as planned.
To be honest, I wish I could cooperate with you and give a wonderful Peking Opera show. However, much to my regret, I will not be available because I was informed yesterday that I would have to go to Shanghai for a debate competition on behalf of our school during that period. As for the performance, I strongly recommend Li Yue, who used to be our club member, to take my place. She is familiar with our show and has the necessary skills, which, combined with her flexible movement and perfect voice, will help make your performance a success.
Sorry again for the inconvenience caused by my absence. I wish your performance to be a great success and hope I will have another chance to join you in the future.
Yours,
Li Hua

I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm really in urgent need of your help.
Ever since last month, my parents haven't allowed me to use mobile phones, because they think
it is a waste of time using apps on the phone, which they believe will affect my study. However, I
don't agree with them. I know l'm a Senior 3 student and I just use the apps related to my study,
such as searching for information on the Internet or looking up new words in the E- dictionary.
Actually, they really help to broaden my horizon and I have made great progress in my study.
To be honest, I have tried to share my ideas with my parents, but they still stick to their opinions.
So what should I do? I really need your help, and I also want to know attitudes of American parents.
I should remain grateful to you for the great help. (表达感激)Looking forward to a prompt reply
from you.(期待回复）
Yours,
Li Hua
