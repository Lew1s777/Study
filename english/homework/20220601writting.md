#### Should parents control their child's use of the internet? ####
- It is a very popular topic that whether paremts should contron their child's use of the internet.From my perspective,They should.
- There is no doubt that childrens always get addicted with the internet and waste a lot of time on it. It is clearly desirahle to make parents control the time of their child's use of the internet.Even though most applications have the unti-addiction function these days,the function is limited to one app rather than the global,which mean with apps swiched,the function made no help to them.
- A reason why many people are against the idea is that they believe various useful information were involved in the internet.However,so do the harmful one.There are a wide range of harmful information in the internet which get daily visit for an incredible amount.Let chiledrens using internet without their parent's control means make them expoesd to such a harmful environment.
- On the whole,parents's control not only avoid children's addiction on electronic devices,but also make sure that harmful contents get away from childrens.Make parents control it is worthwhile.
