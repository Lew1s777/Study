### Analysing situation B
Bob swore back to the man who swore at him due to the fact that bob _accidentally_ stamped on the man's foot.Not only what bob did can not get the man's understanding,but also this will make the conflict advanced,and may eventually lead to a violence.In such a situation,bob should first apologise for his fault,and make it clear that he is not meaning to do that.As the stamping on bus is very common,the man will probably forgive him.
