U1L1 Lifestle

Technology has always been a part of my life,and I’ve always understood that technology is constantly changing.

My goal is to start working more on Web design.
Unfortunately, every time I start coding, I can never find the dedication to keep going.

It emphasized that starting with what you already know is essential, but more importantly, to avoid self doubt.

My goal this semester, and hopefully for the rest of my life, will be to learn for the sake of me. I won’t compare myself to work produced by the greatest of the greats either.

he challenge is not getting discouraged by what is already out there. Technology is ever-changing, so by staying up-to-date and learning for the sake of learning, one can become a successful digital native. I need to stick to it, no matter the squalls, because just like Jim Hawkins from Treasure Planet, I’ve got the makings of greatness in me.
