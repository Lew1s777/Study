# Study repo #
This is my study repository

[中文](./README.cn.md)

Most of my file Were written in ___MarkDown___ format,which means if you want to read it offline,after download/clone the repository,you also need a markdown viewer. My markdown viewer is [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) + [markdownpreviewplgin](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim),if you are not a vim user,[obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) may be a good idea.

Leave a star if you do appreciate this repo.

if you want to clone this repo into your device,type in the command below in your terminal (emulator)
```javascrpit
git clone https://github.com/Lew1s777/Study.git
```
