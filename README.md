# Study repo #
This is my stidy repository

Most of my file Were written in ___MarkDown___ format,which means if you want to read it offline,after download/clone the repository,you also need a markdown viewer. My markdown viewer is [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) + [markdownpreviewplgin](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim),if you are not a vim user,[obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) may be a good choice
Leave a star if you do appreciate this repository
